If you are going to attempt to get exalted with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, our suggestion is that you are max level, have high level gear, and have friends with you.
The quickest way to gain reputation with the Bloodsail Buccaneers is to farm Booty Bay Bruisers.
Bruisers have proven to be incredibly difficult to kill. They have a variety of knockbacks and nets, they have high damage and health, and they will call for help so you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed.
|confirm
step
In order to farm reputation you must be "At War" with Booty Bay. Do this by hitting _[U]_ and finding the Booty Bay reputation among your list. Click on it and then check the box next to "At War" on the new window that appears.

Remember to keep your grip up by using your Grab On ability, and repeat this process until phase 2 of the fight begins.
In phase 2 of the fight with the Wild Wyrm, the strategy changes:
|tip In phase 2 of the fight, you will be inside the Wild Wyrm's mouth.  Repeatedly use your Pry Jaws Open ability, try to stack it 20 times.  After you stack your Pry Jaws ability 20 times (which will give your Fatal Strike ability 100% chance to hit), use your Fatal Strike ability to kill the Wild Wyrm.

While fighting the Wild Wyrm, there will be 2 phases to the fight.  Phase 1:
|tip In phase 1 of the fight, you will be underneath the Wild Wyrm.  Use your Grab On ability to keep your grip high, or you will fall off and die.  Repeatedly use your Thrust Spear ability, until you get a message the Wild Wyrm is about to use its claw attack.  When you see that message, use your Dodge Claws ability, and then immediately use your Mighty Spear Thrust ability after that.  Remember to keep your grip up by using your Grab On ability, and repeat this process until phase 2 of the fight begins.
In phase 2 of the fight with the Wild Wyrm, the strategy changes:
|tip In phase 2 of the fight, you will be inside the Wild Wyrm's mouth.  Repeatedly use your Pry Jaws Open ability, try to stack it 20 times.  After you stack your Pry Jaws ability 20 times (which will give your Fatal Strike ability 100% chance to hit), use your Fatal Strike ability to kill the Wild Wyrm.  If you are close to dying, just stack your Pry Jaws Open ability as many times as you can, then use your Fatal Strike ability before you die, and hope it kills the Wild Wyrm.
