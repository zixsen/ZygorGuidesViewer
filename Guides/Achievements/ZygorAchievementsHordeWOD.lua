_Team communication is crucial to earn this achievement!_
There are _eight cycles of drakes in this encounter_ that cycle through so if you don't kill one it will come back after 7 other cycles come through |tip They do heal during their flight time but not usually to full.
_There is no enrage timer_ for the boss so it's possible to wait if needed
The boss spawns _three adds at 60%_ |tip The tank should focus on the boss while the DPS burn every second drake down.
Focus on _every second drake in each cycle_ during the encounter to get them down to around 30% health so that when the come down a second time after the 7 drake cycle they can be killed

This achievement was buggy at launch, but _seems to be working now_ |tip The stratgy below works with a well coordinated group.
The _tank in the group should just focus on tanking the boss_ while the other four start _kiting the birds around the main pillar_ in the room |tip They can be slowed and kited.
Try to _activate some ashes_ while doing this to save time
_Don't DPS the boss_ because at 75% he will cast Quills and ruin the strategy
When you have the _vast majority of birds kited_ and somewhat damaged _they can be AOE'd down_
|tip Using an AOE stun will keep them from exploding at 0 health until the stun wears off.
You have now _created a nice group of ashes_ for the boss to cast Summon Solar Flare on them
_Wait patiently_ until the risen ash cause more to rise and then kill the boss
