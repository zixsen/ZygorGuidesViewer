In order to earn the achievement _Know Your Role_ you will need to complete Complete each of the Shado-Pan Blackguard daily quests without taking any damage from monsters.
Naturally, the easiest way to get this achievement completed is to have a friend join you and let him do all of the quests while you stay away.
Another way will be to use _Highly Explosive Yaungol Oil_ from the The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy! quest.
|confirm
step
Here is your progress with the achievement:

Assault Fire Camp Gai-Cho |achieve 7308/1
step
For this quest, the absolute easiest way to get it done is by completed the quest with another player.
Assault Deadtalker's Plateau |achieve 7308/2

step

step
This is a tricky achievement to earn.
In order to recieve credit for this, you mus also not take damage from _The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy!_ and _Assault Fire Camp Gai-Cho_.

Challenge Fight: _Epicus Maximus_
Epicus Maximus is one of the four "rare" bosses that you must face. He has 3 abilities:
_Destructolaser_ is a channeled spell that generates a beam that will follow you around the arena. If it touches you it will deal close to 250k damage, so avoid this throughout the fight.
_Blue Crush_ is a 2-second cast that will most likely kill you if you don't interrupt it, or outrange it.
_Pure Rock'n'Roll_ creates orbs that will deal AoE damage that will instantly kill you. Be sure to look out for these throughout the fight.
_The best strategy for this fight is to dps him down quickly. be sure to focus on avoiding the orbs and energy beam, while interrupting the Blue Crush._

Challenge Fight: _Disruption_
Disruption is known as one of the most difficult Brawler's Guild fights in the entire game. He has 2 abilities:
_Static Charge_ is a 3-second cast that will stun you, ending the fight. Stun this or avoid it at all costs.
_Pasics_ are cannons that, along with Disruption itself, spawn lasers around the arena. Touching one of these will come close to instantly killing you if it doesn't kill you.
_The best strategy for this fight is to pay attention to everything around you the best you can. You will have to jump over all the lasers in the arena, while interruping any stun casts. This fight will test all of your abilities, so be prepared for a little frustration._

Challenge Fight: _Millhouse Manastorm_
Millhouse Manastorm is one of the easier fights for this achievement. He has 3 abilities:
_Frostbolt_ is a filler spell that does minor damage and slows you. Ignore this for the most part.
_Shadowbolt_ is a filler spell that does minor damage. Ignore this for the most part.
_Get Off!_ is an instant cast that he will use if you're next to him attacking for too long. It will knock you back and deal arcane damage to you.
_Power Crystals will summon around the room, and shoot a beam of light at Millhouse. Your goal here is to try and block the path between the crystal and Millhouse. They cause 2 buffs:
_Power Overwhelming_ is a buff that can affect either you or Millhouse. This will stack and continuously make you stronger. The power tops out at 500%, but you must still try and steal the buffs from Millhouse.
_Dooooooom!_ will only occur if Millhouse gets 100 stacks of the Power Overwhelming buff. This attack will instantly kill you, and is unavoidable.
_The best strategy for this fight is to move between as many lasers as you can, stealing all the buffs, and saving your cooldowns for when you get 100 stacks of Power._

Challenge Fight: _Zen'shar_
Zen'shar is the easiest rare boss, and at this point you shouldn't have any trouble with him. He has 2 phases:
_Phase 1_ will have adds circling around Zen'shar, while Zen'shar himself is immune to all damage. Your goal here is to AoE his adds down as quickly as possible to move into phase 2.
_Phase 2_ is similar to Disruption's fight, but not as bad. You will have to be constantly moving and dodging lasers, all while focusing on the boss and dps'ing him.
_Evil Glare_ is an ability he uses during phase 2 that will mark an area for an instant kill. As long as you stay moving and avoiding everything, you shouldn't have a problem moving away from this as well.
_The best strategy for this fight is to stay moving, avoid everything in the arena, and kill the boss as quickly as possible.._
