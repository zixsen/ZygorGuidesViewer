		_Eyes of the Destroyer_ will cause Deathwing to fixate on Wrathion. Deathwing deals bonus damage to Wrathion, so heal him as much as possible.
		_Molten Fury_ is a stacking DoT that will be cast on you every time you are struck by Deathwing.
		_Reign of Fire_ summons a large fire storm which does a lot of damage. This attack is fairly easy to avoid.
		_Blood of the Deathborn_ is an interruptable spell, that will spawn a pool of dark red, and deal a ton of damage.
