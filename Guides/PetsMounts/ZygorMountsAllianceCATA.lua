_Heroic: Magmaw and Parasite Evening_
For Parasite Evening, you will need to defeat Magmaw without anyone getting infected with a parasite.
In order to do this, you will need a lot of ranged DPS.
Magmaw will cast _Pillar of Flame_, which will mark the ground with a large red circle.
Move out of it as quickly as you can, as the Parasites will spawn out of it.
If a parasite touches you, you will become infected and fail the achievement.
_You will need to range AoE the Lava Parasites down._
Slow effects will help you kite them around.

_YOU MUST STOP DPS_ at this time, make sure there are no DoTs or pets even.
_Toxitron_ will use an ability called _Poison Protocol_.
He will spawn 3 _Poison Bombs_ that target 3 random raid members.
People who aren't selected will need to DPS the 3 Bombs down before they reach their target.
_Arcanotron will use an ability called _Arcane Annihilator_
You _WILL_ need 2 interrupters for this part. He casts Arcane Annihilator more often than a single person can interrupt.
A shaman with _Reverberation_ as a talent will be able to solo interrupt.
_Magmatron_ will use an ability called _Acquiring Target_ which will be aimed at a random raid member.
For this, you will want the raid group spread out as much as possible.
The person who is the target is allowed to be hit by the flame, _NO ONE ELSE_.

Follow Corlok the Vet as he flies
|tip He will throw groups of skulls at you as he flies, and you have to dodge them.  The easiest strategy is to fly close behind him, but above him, while looking down at him.  Strafe to the sides when he throws the skulls and you can dodge them easily.  Don't let any of the skulls hit you and you will win the race.

Strafe to the sides when he throws the fireballs and you can dodge them easily.  Don't let any of the fireballs hit you and you will win the race.  Also, be careful because he does sharp turns and maneuvers, so it's easy to lose track of him if you aren't careful.

|tip He will throw lightning bolts at you as he flies, and you have to dodge them.  The lightning bolts will follow you, unlike the previous race quests, where the objects they throw did not follow you.  The easiest strategy is to fly beside him, while strafing, and almost ahead of him, if you can.  Don't let any of the lightning bolts hit you and you will win the race.

Stay close to him and the meteors will hit him, as well as you, which will stop him for a second, allowing you to catch up to him, if needed.  You will not get knocked off your mount by the meteors, just stunned for a second, so there's nothing to worry about.

An Argent Champion runs up on a horse
Use the abilities on your hotbar to defeat the Argent Champion
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

An Argent Champion runs up on a horse
Use the abilities on your hotbar to defeat the Argent Champion
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

Fight and defeat them
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Champion riders is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Champion rider (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible).  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Champion rider will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible), then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

An Argent Champion runs up on a horse
Use the abilities on your hotbar to defeat the Argent Champion
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Argent Champion is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Argent Champion.  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Argent Champion will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back, then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.
