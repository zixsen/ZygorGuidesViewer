Fight 5: _Dippy_
|tip Dippy is the first fight in rank 2 and has the following abilities:
|tip Slippy is a constant debuff that causes him to fall down with every direct hit. This interrupts the current cast of Peck. This will not happen if Dippy is next to a wall.
|tip Peck is a very quick casted spell that will instantly kill you. Unless you are strictly a melee class, the best option in this fight is to kite him and kill him from range.
|tip The best strategy for this fight is to keep pressue on Dippy, and never give him a chance to cast his Peck. Any direct strike will do, so don't rely on DoTs to knock him over.

|tip Storm Cloud is an ability that summons a cloud to inflict Nature damage when Kirrawk is attacked. Interrupt this whenever possible.
|tip Tornado is an ability that summons a twister that will toss you up somewhere in the arena, and will make a straight line towards you. The only way to avoid this is to have the tornado touch Kirrawk before it touches you.
|tip Lightning Flurry is an ability that he will only cast if you are tossed up by his Tornado. This attack does considerable damage.
|tip The best strategy for this fight is to pay attention to the tornado, and make sure it hits him instead of you. Also, pay attention to his casts and interrupt Storm Cloud any way you can.

|tip Throw Net is his basic ability. It is a quick cast, and immobilizes you for 5 seconds.
|tip Frenzied Riddoh is an ability that will only be used if you kill Fran first. This causes Riddoh's attacks to deal 250% damage
|tip Fran_ should be your secondary Target and has the following abilities:
|tip Throw Dynamite is his basic ability. He throws a stick of dynamite in the air that can be avoided.
|tip Goblin Device is an ability that summons a a ring of bombs around you. You will have to run out of the circle before they explode.

|tip Blat is where the difficulty starts to raise a bit. He has 1 ability:
|tip Split is a 0.5 second cast spell that causes him to create a copy of himself. He will use this several times throughout the fight.
|tip The best strategy for this fight is to kite him away, and focus on the main version of him. If you can't kite, then just try and do as much dps as possible. All of the other versions have as much health as he does, so you will not be able to kill them fast enough to avoid the enrage timer.

Sanoriak is basically a more powerful version of Vian the Volatile. He has 4 abilities:
|tip Fireball and Pyroblast are both his most common moves. They do quite a bit of damage, so interrupt them every now and then if possible.
|tip Flame Buffet is a strong move that does a lot of damage and increases any fire damage taken for 15 seconds. Interrupt this as much as possible.
|tip Firewall is his most powerful move. It will not show a casting bar, but he will show the animation. This spawns a rain of fireballs down on your location. Be sure to move out of this, because it does a ton of damage.
|tip The best strategy for this fight is to keep pressure on him, avoid his AoE meteor attack, and interrupt/stun whenever possible.
