_Phase 1_
|tip Eye Beam, a green energy beam, is cast every 3 seconds by Eye of C'Thun and deals about 3000 Nature damage to a random target. If another player is within 10 yards of this target, the beam will jump to them, dealing 1.5x the damage dealt to the previous target. Raid members will want to stay spread out to avoid this happening.
|tip Dark Glare a red energy beam, deals about 50,000 Shadow damage to any player who passes through the beam. The initial target is random, but he will rotate 180 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. When this happens, move out of its way.
|tip Eye Tentacle will spawn 8 small eye tentacles every 45 seconds, knocking back anyone within a few yards of their spawn point.  They use Mind Flay which deals 750 damage every second for 3 seconds. If the group is ready for them they are easily killed due to their low hit points.
|tip Claw Tentacle spawn at random locations very often. When they spawn they deal about 1500 damage and a knockback.
_Phase 2_
|tip This starts as soon as the Eye of C'Thun's health reaches 0.
|tip Giant Claw Tentacle spawns about every minute. These deal 3500 damage with Ground Rupture, and will need to be tanked due to their high damage. If no one is in range for an attack they will burrow and reappear with full health, repeating the Ground Rupture attack.
|tip Giant Eye Tentacle spawns about every minute. These also deal significant damage with Ground Rupture and they cast _Eye Beam_, which bounces off nearby raid members. Killing these are a priority.
_Stomach of C'Thun_
|tip Every 10 seconds, a random raid member will be swallowed by C'Thun and dropped into his stomach. Swim out of the acid pools and onto one of the patches of land. _Flesh Tentacles_ have 25,000 health and killing them weakens C'Thun, causing him to turn purple and become vulnerable for 45 seconds. This is the time you use to attack and kill him.

All boss encounters in this raid are in Heroic Mode and the raid is given 50 attempts to complete it.
