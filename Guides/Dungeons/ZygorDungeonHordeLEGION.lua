|tip Kil'Jaeden will gain several new abilities. The most important one being Darkness of a Thousand Souls. This will deal a large amount of damage to everyone in the raid. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip When this phase starts, he will cast this ability. Everyone must stack up under the boss and use raid-wide damage reduction/healing cooldowns. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Demonic Obelisks will spawn around the room in random positions. After a short time they will shoot out 4 green beams. These need to be avoided. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip There will be more of these appearing the longer the fight goes on, giving this fight a soft enrage timer. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Next, he will periodically summon a Rift on a random position on the outskirts of this platform. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Avoid standing in this unless you are getting ready to soak the Darkness of a Thousand Souls, or if you are kiting the Flaming Orb. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip For every other cast of Darkness of a Thousand Souls, you will need to run into the green circle indicated from where the Rift is. This will absorb the damage from this ability. Once Darkness is finished casting, be sure to leave the rift ASAP. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip On Heroic difficulty, he will summon a Flaming Orb on a random raid member. After a short time, it will spawn and focus the closest player to it. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip A player with high mobility should stand next to the Flaming Orb. Once spawned, this player should move the Orb into the active Rift. The Rift will then suck up the Flaming Orb. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Focused Dreadflame will target a random raid member and, after a short time, send out a beam of damage. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip The person targeted by this ability will need to get into a good position and stand still. Players not targeted will need to stand in between the boss and the person targetd to split the damage. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip On Heroic difficulty, players soaking this beam, when hit, will explode, dealing damage to anyone within 5 yards of them. When soaking, you want to be spaced out. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip He will also cast Bursting Dreadflame. This will target several random raid members. This ability will place a large circle around them and, after a short time, within this circle will take damage. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Players with Bursting Dreadflame will need to run to the outsides of the room, seperating from one another to reduce damage taken. |grouprole EVERYONE
_HEALER:_ |grouprole HEALER
|tip Use healing cooldowns on the first Darkness of a Thousand Souls. |grouprole HEALER
|tip After the first Darkness is cast, the entire raid will take heavy damage every 2 seconds for the rest of the encounter. Try to keep everyone up as best as possible. |grouprole HEALER
|tip Prepare to heal the tanks when the boss uses Felclaws. |grouprole HEALER
_TANK:_ |grouprole TANK
|tip Kil'Jaeden will cast Felclaws, lasting 12 seconds. Each auto attack will place a debuff on the tank, increasing all physical damage taken for 20 seconds. This stacks. |grouprole TANK
|tip The active tank will need to use cooldowns to last through the entire 12 seconds. Once this ability is over, the other tank needs to taunt. |grouprole TANK
|tip Face the boss away from the raid. |grouprole TANK
