_TANK:_ |grouprole TANK
|tip Source of Chaos, this mechanic will come out and go on the tank with the highest threat on the boss, this will push the tank back trying to push them off the edge and will deal increasing damage over time. |grouprole TANK
|tip Source of Chaos is a very difficult mechanic to deal with as the crystal that causes this mechanic has a significt amount of health, dependent on what you think your team can do you can either try to kill this before your tank dies or you can save battles resurrections and just let them die. |grouprole TANK
__HEALER:__ |grouprole HEALER

_EVERYONE:_ |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Seeding Corruption this mechanic is basically the saftey dance from Naxxaramas, the boss has 4 set patterns and will choose one random one each time he casts this, just dont stand in the green when it forms. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Just like in normal/heroic Rain of Chaos will happen spawning infernals, but instead of spawning the same amount each time it increases over time spawning more farther into the fight. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip The raid also only has 12 seconds to kill these mobs as they will start casting there aoe ability after those 12 seconds. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Be sure to spread the infernals apart and kill them asap. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Void stars are also the same mechanic as normal/heroic but in mythic instead of one spawning at a time 4 will spawn, they don't have much hp but need to be slowed and killed. |grouprole EVERYONE

Roar of the Crowd
|tip This mechanic rewards the players of the raid with a damage buff for doing the rest of the mechanics properly.
|tip One thing to point out with this new mechanic "Roar of the Crowd", berserking rush can be immuned and if you allow the berserking rush to go through its whole duration the raid will get a huge increase in damage. Berserking rush can be immuned rather its iceblook, deterence, pally bubble, or evasion.
|tip Be wary that if a player dies during the fight your "Roar of the Crowd" bar will be reduced, thus reducing everyones damage.
_TANK:_ |grouprole TANK
|tip Tank Kargath in the center of the arena. Cooldowns are useful for Impale, which deals heavy damage and leaves Open Wounds. |grouprole TANK
|tip The tank with the highest Open Wounds stack is thrown into the stands. |grouprole TANK
|tip Tanks should taunt swap after every 2 stacks of Open Wounds. |grouprole TANK
_HEALER:_ |grouprole HEALER
|tip Tanks will take heavy damage from Impale, especially if they are already affected by Open Wounds. |grouprole HEALER
|tip If targeted by Berserker Rush, kite Kargath through a flame pillar. |grouprole HEALER
|tip The cats in the pit will come out periodically and will cast "On the Hunt" on a random player, this mechanic is just like berserking rush, you will need to kite the cats into the flame pillars. |grouprole HEALER
_DAMAGE:_ |grouprole DAMAGE
|tip If you are targeted by Berserker Rush, kite him through one of the flame pillars. |grouprole DAMAGE
|tip The cats in the pit will come out periodically and will cast "On the Hunt" on a random player, this mechanic is just like berserking rush, you will need to kite the cats into the flame pillars and then kill them. |grouprole DAMAGE
|tip Killing the cats are the top priority for dps in the arena they must die asap, they will take more damage once kited into the pillars of fire. |grouprole DAMAGE
Chain Hurl Team:
|tip Chain hurl will target the 5 closest people to the boss and hurl them up into the stands, This will need to consist of 3 dps 1 healer and 1 tank.
|tip The stands group needs to kill as many enemys as fast as possible, killing these enemys will reduce the damage the raid takes on the bottom and increase the raids "Roar of the Crowd".
|tip Kill Bileslingers and Iron Bombers first. Bombers explode upon death - move away.
_EVERYONE:_ |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Circles of fire will come down from the stands during the entire fight, don't stand in these as they do a very large amount of damage. |grouprole EVERYONE
|tip Be sure your looking at your debuffs if you are targeted by berserking rush or on the hunt and they melee you it will be a one shot and will reduce the raids damage. |grouprole EVERYONE

|tip There should be 2 groups of melee with one person in each group to toggle. |grouprole DAMAGE
|tip These groups should be 3-5 players with one person to toggle out of the group to allow the debuff gushing wounds to reset. |grouprole DAMAGE
|tip Every two stacks of gushing wounds the groups should switch to allow the debuff to wear off, to do this the toggle, preferably a player with high mobility such as a hunter, would run out of their respected group until the debuff is off. |grouprole DAMAGE

kill Cho'gall##43324
Phase 4
|tip Once Imperator Mar'gok is at 5 percent the last phase will start, the boss will start doing his rp and eventually become immune and die.
|tip While this is happening a bunch of adds will spawn from all around the room, these have no special attacks or abilities but need to be stacked up and killed together, when they die they will leave a pool on the group dont stand in this.
|tip During this phase Cho'gal will be the new boss encounter, he will have a whole new set of abilities.
_Cho'gall_
|tip During the Cho'gal fight the adds in the transition will continue to spawn every 30 seconds in waves, they need to be killed together asap.
|tip Glimpse of Maddness will spawn a shadow on a random player and start casting "Gaze of the Abyss" onto the closest player and keep applying this debuff every 6 seconds.
_Gaze of the Abyss_
|tip This ability will put a debuff on a player causeing damage to that player until it runs out.
|tip With each stack of this debuff the damage gets higher and higher, once this debuff expires(this can be done by no longer being the closest target to the Glimpse of Maddness) then the debuff will explode for damage to the player and anyone within 8 yards.
|tip The explosion will do more damage the more stacks the player has.

|tip This ability is a very long cast and will deal a large amount of damage to the entire raid once completed.
|tip Every cast of this ability increase its damage.
_Infinite Darkness_
|tip This ability will be cast on 3 random players all healing will be absorbed on this player until it is dispelled, once dispelled all of the healing that was done to those players will spread as a shield equally across the entire raid.
|tip This will help, if timed correctly, with the higher raid damage of the fight such as "Enveloping Night".
_Dark Star_
|tip This ability will spawn an orb of darkness on a random player in the raid, after a short time this star will explode for massive damage to any player in a range of 20 yards to the star.
|tip The Dark Star can only spawn on ranged so ranged should stand at least 20 yards away from the boss/melee so that they dont have to move.
