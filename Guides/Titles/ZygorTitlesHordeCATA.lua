You will need to farm Cenarion Circle and Cenarion Expedition reputation.
Farming rep in the dungeons Slave Pens and Underbog is a good way to gain reputation up to Honored.
You can also kill naga or any mobs for Unidentified Plant Parts until friendly.
You can also grind reputation from Heroic Coilfang Instances up to Exalted if you would rather do that.
Coilfang Armaments drop in normal Steamvaults, as well as heroic Coilfang instances.
