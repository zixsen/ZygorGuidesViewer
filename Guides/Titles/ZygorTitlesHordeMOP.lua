_Slippy_ is a constant debuff that causes him to fall down with every direct hit. This interrupts the current cast of _Peck_. This will not happen if Dippy is next to a wall.
_Peck_ is a very quick casted spell that will instantly kill you. Unless you are strictly a melee class, the best option in this fight is to kite him and kill him from range.
_The best strategy for this fight is to keep pressue on Dippy, and never give him a chance to cast his Peck. Any direct strike will do, so don't rely on DoTs to knock him over_

_Lightning Flurry_ is an ability that he will only cast if you are tossed up by his Tornado. This attack does considerable damage.
_The best strategy for this fight is to pay attention to the tornado, and make sure it hits him instead of you. Also, pay attention to his casts and interrupt Storm Cloud any way you can_

_Fran_ should be your secondary Target and has the following abilities:
_Throw Dynamite_ is his basic ability. He throws a stick of dynamite in the air that can be avoided.
_Goblin Device_ is an ability that summons a a ring of bombs around you. You will have to run out of the circle before they explode.

Blat is where the difficulty starts to raise a bit. He has 1 ability:
_Split_ is a 0.5 second cast spell that causes him to create a copy of himself. He will use this several times throughout the fight.
_The best strategy for this fight is to kite him away, and focus on the main version of him. If you can't kite, then just try and do as much dps as possible. All of the other versions have as much health as he does, so you will not be able to kill them fast enough to avoid the enrage timer_

_Flame Buffet_ is a strong move that does a lot of damage and increases any fire damage taken for 15 seconds. Interrupt this as much as possible.
_Firewall_ is his most powerful move. It will not show a casting bar, but he will show the animation. This spawns a rain of fireballs down on your location. Be sure to move out of this, because it does a ton of damage.

_Collision_ is an ability that he will use often. You will see him jump to somewhere in the arena, and pause before charging at you. Make sure to run out of his path when he's charging, otherwise you will take a lot of damage and be stunned for 5 seconds.

_Mechano Kick_ is an ability that he will use often. It does 50% damage, but knocks you back, so make sure you're not around the lightning.

Fight 17: _Millie Watt_
Millie Watt is a tricky opponent that has abilities that you will have to rely on to stay alive. She has 3 abilities:
_Electric Dynamite_ is an attack that creates electric void zones. These do a lot of damage, but are needed to save you from a more damaging attack.
_Megafantastic Discombobumorphanator_ is her most devastating attack. This is a 4-second cast that will turn you into a chicken, then cause you to take 100k damage every 2 seconds. The only way to counter this is to run into the void zones created by the dynamite before she finishes casting.
_Photoplasm Buster Ray_ is a channeled attack that will do a stream of arcane damage. This is not really a concern.
_The best strategy for this fight is to keep an eye on her abilities, stay out of the void zones until her morphing spell is almost complete, and attack her from the front, because her back is bladed_

Fight 28: _Meatball_
Meatball is a very easy boss, consider it a reward for making it through Battletron. There is only 1 mechanic you need to worry about:
_Strange Energy_ is scattered throughout the arena. Your goal is to run around collecting all of these, causing a stacking buff on your character.
_The best strategy for this fight is to gather as many orbs as you can, and use the damage buff to kill Meatball super quickly_
